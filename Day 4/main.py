# Banker Roulette Excercise - my solution
# You are working in a team of developers.
# Another developer has written the code to import the names in the inputs
# You can run the code to see what this names list looks like.
# Then change the names in the input to see how it imports the names.
# print(names)
# 🚨 Remember to remove the print statement above when you submit.

# random_name = names
# num_to_select = 1

# used the random.sample method to select a random name from the list
# list_of_random_names = random.sample(random_name, num_to_select)
# first_random_name = list_of_random_names[0]

# print(f"{first_random_name} is going to buy the meal today!")

# Teacher solution
# names = names_string.split(", ")
# import random

# # Get total number of items in list
# num_items = len(names)

# # Generate random numbers between 0 and the last index
# random_choice = random.randint(0, num_items - 1)

# # Choose and print random name
